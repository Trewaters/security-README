# `security.md` - Responsible Security Disclosure README standard

## Our security policy and Your responsibility
- **POLICY**:

*Our security policy is to avoid leaving the ecosystem worse than we found it. Meaning we are not planning to introduce vulnerabilities into the ecosystem.*

- **SECURITY DISCLOSURE**:

*Your responsibility is to report vulnerabilities to us using the guidelines outlined below.*

Discuss in tl;dr ( or ELI5 ) how someone could/should disclose a vulnerability to "MY-PROJECT". Then expand on this with "How To Disclose a vulnerability in detail". Please give detailed steps on how to disclose the vulnerability. Keep these OWASP guidelines in mind ( https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Vulnerability_Disclosure_Cheat_Sheet ) when creating your disclosure policy. Below are some recommendations for security disclosures:
- "MY-PROJECT" security contacts { contact: mailto:trewaters@hotmail.com }
- Communication expectations: How much time it could take "MY-PROJECT" to respond? What type of response to expect?
- Disclosure format: When disclosing vulnerabilities please 
  1. include scope of vulnerability, 
  2. document steps to identify and 
  3. how to exploit vulnerability
