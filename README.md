# security-README
I am modifying an idea that was proposed here ( https://github.com/securitytxt/security-txt ). I am making a template and guidelines for the `security.md` ReadMe file. Basically designers should still create a "security text file" and place it in the `/.well-known/` directory but the Policy `.html` should point to this `security.md` file if it is an open-source project. 

My hope is it will improve reporting and fixing vulnerabilities when they are discovered. It is something I think should be in all open source commits from day one.

- `security.md` has all the definitions and descriptions of what I propose.
- `./TEMPLATES/security.md` is a copy and paste for those that just want to get up and running.
